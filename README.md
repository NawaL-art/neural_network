# Salary Prediction Neural Network

A simple neural network built with NumPy that predicts normalized salaries based on years of experience, education level, and skills.

## Features

- Single-layer neural network with sigmoid activation
- Trained with backpropagation
- Predicts salary scaled between 0 and 1

## Usage

1. Run the script `neural_network_salary.py`
2. It trains on example data and predicts salaries for new inputs

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Run

```bash
python neural_network_salary.py
